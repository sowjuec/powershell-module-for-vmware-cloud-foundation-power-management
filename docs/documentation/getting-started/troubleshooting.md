# Troubleshooting

- For VMware Cloud Foundation 4.4 and earlier, the SSH service on the ESXi hosts must be running. SSH must be accessible from the machine running the scripts.

- In the event of a failure, attempt to run the script with the same parameters in order to overcome the errors. If unsuccessful, identify the step that is causing the issue and continue the sequence following the manual guidance in VMware Cloud Foundation documentation.

- During shutdown of the management domain, if SDDC Manager is already powered off, the only option is to continue by following the manual guidance in the VMware Cloud Foundation documentation.
